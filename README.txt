This is me work for following along a youtube tutorial on coding neural networks from scratch by sentdex. This is not my code.

I used this to get a better understanding of how neural networks, and to better understand the code behind them. After using Tensorflow, Pytorch, and Scikit-Learn
I wanted a better understanding of how the functions work on a fundamental level.
